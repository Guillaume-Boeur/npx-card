# npx card

    My first tool, with npx during junior web dev formation at BeCode.

    Type of challenge: learning
    Team : solo
    Version : 1.0.0


# Explanation

    In this first version (1.0.0), it's a copy from [https://github.com/leny/npxcard](https://github.com/leny/npxcard) just to learn npx. In the next version, it will be my own npx card.

## Command in Terminal :

```terminal
$ npx guib
```
